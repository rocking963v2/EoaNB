 sepoy.1.d:0 "The year is 1857, and our country has suddenly been ripped into an abyss of turmoil and war. Rising conflict between the British East India Company and our people have led to an incident this morning that has sparked a war: A Mutiny in Meerut.

 usa.0.t:0 "The Divided States of America"
 usa.0.d:0 "It is a bleak time for the United States. Ever since we declared ourselves independent, we have been plagued by the issue of Slavery. Although the United States would implement policies on Slavery, such as the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807, but even still this institution would continue. \n \nThere were many compromises between the Free States and the Slave States. The Free States were found primarily in the North, which consisted of rockier soil and colder climates. These factors moved the North away from agriculture and toward industrialization, therefore pushing the instituion of slavery out of the North. Meanwhile, the South's warmer climate and rich soil made large, plantation-based agriculture ubiquitous in the region, and as such made the institution of slavery prevalent there. \n \nDebates would arise concerning which states would be allowed to have Slavery, resulting in a power struggle between the Northern States and Southern states, until the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which stipulated that the 36°30' line, which made up Missouri's southern border, become the new border between North and South. States North of this line would be free and states South of it would have slavery. \n \nThis Compromise would be broken 3 decades later, however, with the Mexican-American War resulting in states like Texas and California joining the Union. The size of Texas and the wish for California to become a free state reignited the debate over Slavery. This would lead to the Compromise of 1850, which was devised by Whig Senator Henry Clay and Democratic politician Stephen A. Douglas, and the compromise stipulated the introduction of a Fugitive Slave clause which sparked more tension, as well as the enactment of Popular Sovereignty, allowing for states themselves to choose between adopting slavery or becoming a free state. A notable issue with the idea of Popular Sovereignty arose with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which led to issues such as the incident known as Bleeding Kansas, where Northern and Southern migrants to Kansas would incite violence to turn Kansas to their side of the Slave Debate. \n \nThe debate over Slavery has taken a hard turn, with the Whig party dead and the rise of the Republican Party, which received 33% of the vote in the Election of 1856, but had still lost the election to Buchanan, a Democrat. \n \nThe future of the United States is in question."

The result was ruled that Dred Scott, who resided in a free state, was not entitled to his freedom and that African-Americans could not be citizens of the United States.

 usa.6.d:0 "Introduced by Stephen Douglas in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed for the people in the Kansas and Nebraska territories to choose if they would want slavery or not. This has led to many Northern Abolitionists and Southern Pro-Slavery activists to move to Kansas to push for their beliefs in the conflict over Slavery. This has spilled blood many times, one example being abolitionist John Brown who led his sons and other followers to attack farmers who supported slavery. \n \nRecently, the Marais des Cygnes massacre occurred, where Pro-Slavery Border Ruffians killed 5 Anti-Slavery men. With the tensions over the Slave Debate high, this has led to more conflict in the Kansas Territory."

Lee and his men were able to defeat Brown's party of 22 men and retake the arsenal. He was able to capture 7 of them, including John Brown, while 10 were killed and 5 fled before being captured."

In his memoir before being executed, John Brown wrote: \"I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood. I had, as I now think, vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it might be done.\" In the North, many have started to called him a martyr, while the South is relieved that a well-known terrorist is put to justice."

 usa.9.d:0 "In 1850, in order to deal with the new territory acquired from the Mexican-American War, the United States was divided again on slavery, until it came to the Compromise of 1850. In the contents, it issued many things, such as California's admission as a Free State. \n \nHowever, issues are arising with the Fugitive Slave Law that was enacted alongside the Compromise. Any Slave that flees into the North is to be taken back to their slaveowners. This clause has led to it becoming an issue with the Slavery Debate heating up, and some Northerners have been arrested for having hid runaway slaves in order to protect them."

 usa.10.d:0 "The day has come for every American to leave their homes and head to the polls to vote for who will become President. \n \nThe campaigning was tough, with the issue of Slavery being the primary issue. The Republican Party's nominee is Abraham Lincoln, a charismatic figure that opposes expansion of Slavery. The Democratic Party is split between two different candidates. The Northern Democrats favor Stephen A Douglas, who favors a moderate solution to the Slavery Issue and therefore will likely not receive many votes. The Southern Democrats call for John Breckinridge as the Democratic nominee, who is the current Vice President under Buchanan, who promises to ensure the institution of slavery in the west. Finally, John Bell, an infleuntial politician and former Senator, has taken an entirely neutral stance on the slavery issue and has established a new political party dubbed the Constitutional Union Party, in favor of unifying the divided North and South however possible. \n \nThis may be the tipping point that decides on the issue of slavery. If neither North nor South gets their favored candidate, they may rebel against the current system. But for now, the new President of the United States is..."

It seems as though the only ones that would refuse this were the rich White plantation owners in the South and radical abolitionists in the North, who have lost support when the Referendum had been announced. \n \nThere are four different plans for a Referendum. 1: The Abolition Plan, which, if passed, would ban the practice of Slavery, 2: The Popular Sovereignty Plan, on which people can vote if their state wants or doesn't want slavery, 3: The 30 Years' Plan, where the US would slowly cut down on Slavery until total abolition is achieved in a span of about 30 years, or 4: The Reformed Slavery Plan, which promises to implement a form of Slavery that prohibits harsh treatment of Slaves. \n \nThe time to choose is now, the fate of the nation is in our hands..."

Although this will upset some of the Radicals from both sides, this has drastically calmed tensions on both sides of the debate. It seems like John Bell has brought the nation together, and has finally solved the issue on slavery.

However, having the mod on GitHub with that many devs working on it automatically means that it is virtually impossible for us to regularly update the Steam version on the workshop. Consequently, the Steam version is only updated when major updates come out, being the reason for why EoaNB is perceived as \"idle\" or \"dead\" by many when only looking at the workshop page. Still, what has already been explained on the official workshop page is often overlooked.\n\nIf you want to experience an up-to-date End of a New Beginning, the first step would be to join our official Discord (linked on the workshop). After that, you can look up how to install the GitHub version in our #frequently_asked_questions channel.

 prussia.10.d:0 "The Prussians have requested military access through our lands - they claim they need our roads as supply routes to supply their troops in the Rhine Area. The question now is - do we want to support this ordeal?"
 prussia.10.a:0 "Sure, there is no issue with it."
 prussia.10.b:0 "Why would we just give them access?"
 prussia.11.t:0 "Hannover accepts!"
 prussia.11.d:0 "Hannover accepted our request for military access - we are now free to move troops and supply through their country."
 prussia.11.a:0 "Great!"
 prussia.12.t:0 "Hannover denies our request!"
 prussia.12.d:0 "Hannover denied our request for military access - it looks like the supply routes through their lands will remain out of our grasp for some time. Shall we just accept this or take this as an insult to Prussian Authority?"

 prussia.12.b:0 "They will pay for that!"
 prussia.13.t:0 "The End of Neuchatel Crisis"
 prussia.13.d:0 "Our relationship with the Principality of Neuchatel has been...strained, over the previous century. We came to own it in 1707, and, over the next century, it switched hands between us and the French twice. In 1815, Frederick William III of Prussia decided to allow the small Principality to join the Swiss Confederation while still remaining under our effective control. Yet, in 1848, those ungrateful dogs revolted against our rule! Since then, we have been pressing our claim to the region. We finally thought the Swiss might concede, as Neuchatel monarchists loyal to the Prince revolted, but, with the support of the British, they rebutted our claim. We are forced to allow the independence of this small province."

 prussia.17.d:0 "Recently, doctor Robert Avé-Lallemant came back from his journeys in Brazil. While this in itself is quite positive news, the news he bears aren't that good. Germans who decided to emigrate to Brazil are being exploited by fazendeiros, all-powerful owners of coffee plantations. They lack food, medical care, and due to nature of the system they were tricked into, they constatnly fall deeper and deeper into debts. As Avé-Lallemant put it, it is a human butchery. We must act, therefore we shall disallow any emigration for recruitment to Brazil"

 prussia.24.d:0 "The Prussian Postal Service has been in operation since 1806, but only as recently as 1850 has Prussia gotten its own Postal Stamps. Now, with the recent administrative reforms and expansion of the system, it is working better than ever."
 prussia.24.a:0 "Good."

 prussia.25.d:0 "Prussia mourns today, as one of our greatest field marshals has passed. Karl Friedrich Emil zu Dohna-Schlobitten died in his bed during the last night in Berlin.

 #Bavaria
 bavariafocus.0.t:0 "Maximilian II Dead!"
 bavariafocus.0.d:0 "Today the Kingdom mourns. As of late, our precious King of Bavaria Maximilian II suffered under a severe illness. After being ill for a total of three days, Maximilian's body could no longer withstand the disease and fell victim to it. Maximilian II, being King of Bavaria for 16 years, died on the 10th March 1864, ultimately leaving the throne empty. This event will certainly influence the very existence of our Kingdom."
 bavariafocus.0.a:0 "May the King rest in peace."
 bavariafocus.1.t:0 "Ludwig II Decides"
 bavariafocus.1.d:0 "As the oldest son of Maximilian II with a right to the throne, Ludwig II Otto Friedrich Wilhelm von Wittelsbach ascended at the age of just 18 years after his fathers death, and is now officially the new King of Bavaria. Seeing as how the young King could be or have been a subject of manipulation from a foreign state, many politicians are worried about how Ludwig could behave in the future. In an attempt to eliminate this risk, a proposal has been made by some of the worried, which would try to persuade the King. The proposal would try to bring Ludwig II closer to his fathers work, and maybe even push for the continuation of the Triaspolitik. However, a lot of people think that this would lead to no result, as Ludwig never was and probably still isn't interested in his fathers work and way of ruling. Whatever we decide to do, this will impact the future of the Kingdom of Bavaria greatly."
 bavariafocus.1.a:0 "We must try to persuade the King."
 bavariafocus.1.b:0 "He's still just a kid. Let him be. This won't change anything for us."
 bavariafocus.2.t:0 "Pick our Side"
 bavariafocus.2.d:0 "We are now at the point where we have to choose a side. The Prussians in the north could be a strong ally, but the Austrians share a lot of similarities with us, unlike the Prussians. If we want to keep our Kingdom, culture and people safe, we have to act now."
 bavariafocus.2.a:0 "The Prussians are different than us, but they'll be a great ally and able to protect us."
 bavariafocus.2.b:0 "No way we will ally with the Prussian beasts. Austria is a much better choice."
 bavariafocus.3.t:0 "Ludwig II Dead!"
 bavariafocus.3.d:0 "Yet again a tragedy hits the Wittelsbachs. Today Ludwig II, the eldest son of Maximilian II, was found dead, bleeding onto the white duvet cover, in his room by a maid, after she seemingly heard some kind of commotion going on inside. After she hesitantly entered the room no one aside from the dead Ludwig was in it anymore. His throat was pierced with a sharp knife or sword. The assassination and its real reason remain a mistery for now, but it is clear that the murder is connected to Maximilian's death and Ludwig's planned ascension of the throne."
 bavariafocus.3.a:0 "Everything went according to plan then."
 bavariafocus.4.t:0 "Luitpold von Bayern Takes the Throne!"
 bavariafocus.4.d:0 "After the death of Ludwig II and the following public commotion, Luitpold Karl Joseph Wilhelm von Bayern felt obligated to restore at least a part of the stability lost because of the lack of a King. As Otto I, Ludwig's younger brother and the next Prince to succeed the throne suffers under a mental illness, Luitpold will act as a Prince Regent for the time being."
 bavariafocus.4.a:0 "This might become a nuisance for us."
 bavariafocus.5.t:0 "Triaspolitik"
 bavariafocus.5.d:0 "The so-called Trias is a try of the southern German states to strengthen their bond and affront the great Germanic powers, being Prussia and Austria. The main contributors to this idea are Württemberg with Karl Augustus von Wangenheim, Bavaria with Maximilian II, the current King of Bavaria, and Prime Minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust from Hannover. This idea of a unified coalition in the south again experienced an upsurge in popularity after the German Revolution and is even being supported by France. Following the Prussian attempt at pulling through the Lesser Germany, the Four Kings Alliance became reality, consisting of Bavaria, Saxony, Hannover and Württemberg, which mainly supports the Greater Austrian Plan."
 bavariafocus.5.a:0 "Bavaria should be the one to lead the Trias."
 bavariafocus.6.t:0 "Bavarian Proposal"
 bavariafocus.6.d:0 "Bavaria today proposed to strengthen our bond and maybe even establish an alliance, seeing how the tension between Austria and Prussia keeps on growing. Accepting the Bavarian proposal may have its benefits, but many think that the old idea of the Trias, a try of the southern German states to strengthen their bond and affront the great Germanic powers, would lead to both Austria and Prussia being against us. We should decide carefully."
 bavariafocus.6.a:0 "We should accept Bavarias proposal. Let's grow stronger together."
 bavariafocus.6.b:0 "This proposal will be of no benefit to our nation. Deny it."
 bavariafocus.7.t:0 "Bavarian Proposal"
 bavariafocus.7.d:0 "Bavaria today proposed to strengthen the bond between our countries. While we did not make that much common policy in the past, Bavaria may be a good ally to have. If we were to accept, however, we must keep in mind that we would attract attention from both Prussia and Austria. Let us decide carefully."
 bavariafocus.7.a:0 "We should accept Bavarias proposal. Let's grow stronger together."
 bavariafocus.7.b:0 "This proposal will be of no benefit to our nation. Deny it."
 bavariafocus.8.t:0 "Bavaria Proposes a Süddeutscher Zollverein"
 bavariafocus.8.d:0 "As of late the relations between our country and Bavaria have been developing very well. We gained a few new allies, too, and now they proposed a new kind of Zollverein. Accepting this new South German Zollverein would mean getting rid of the old one and upsetting Prussia. Still, this proposal is not a bad move from Bavaria, wanting to exclude their enemies from the new Zollverein. In other words, Bavaria thinks of us as an ally."
 bavariafocus.8.a:0 "A brilliant idea! This will be of great benefit to our economy."
 bavariafocus.8.b:0 "This is just an attempt by Bavaria to grab more power. Don't let them succeed."
 bavariafocus.9.t:0 "Bavaria proposes the South German Confederation!"
 bavariafocus.9.d:0 "The South German Zollverein became reality and now Bavaria wants to push even further. The proposed South German Confederation is a military and economic alliance between allied German middle states. Accepting it means giving up on getting Prussia or Austria as allies and being on our own. There are two ways this could turn out - either the new South German Confederation is not supported by many middle states, marking its demise, or it becomes the Third Deutschland, the third big power in middle Europe. We do not like to gamble with the future with our country, but in this case it seems to be inevitable."
 bavariafocus.9.a:0 "Our country wants to be a part of this new Confederation. This will mark a new era."
 bavariafocus.9.b:0 "There is no way we will agree. It's suicide."
 bavariafocus.10.t:0 "Bavarian Protestantism Dead?"
 bavariafocus.10.d:0 "Catholicism is a part of Bavarian history and culture. Abolishing it would mean abolishing our culture, and no one wants that to happen. The Catholic Church will be a part of our country forever."
 bavariafocus.10.a:0 "This is for the best."
 bavariafocus.11.t:0 "Bavaria Accepts Protestantism"
 bavariafocus.11.d:0 "Today Bavaria lost a piece of its culture. The state offically recognized Protestantism, making it the state religion. Many are not content with this development, however, namely the 'classic' Catholic Church and conservative groups."
 bavariafocus.11.a:0 "Let us see how this will develop."
 bavariafocus.12.t:0 "Conservatives Resist!"
 bavariafocus.12.d:0 "Following our recent pro-Protestantism policies, a bunch of conservative Bavarian groups have been raising their voices. They demand that we stop 'destroying their beloved culture' and come back to old standards. Whatever we do, we should prepare for the backlash."
 bavariafocus.12.a:0 "Let them scream for a bit and eventually their cries will dampen. We're doing the right thing."
 bavariafocus.12.b:0 "Maybe we shouldn't be as aggressive. Let's do some talking first."
 bavariafocus.13.t:0 "Bavarian Protestantism Fails!"
 bavariafocus.13.d:0 "Our try to officially recognize Protestantism backfired. Many armed groups went on to strike and protest against our recent non-conservative moves. The Catholic Church prevailed and only widened its reach. All this effort - for nothing."
 bavariafocus.13.a:0 "Can't they see that they're destroying our country?!"
 bavariafocus.14.t:0 "Bavarian Protestantism Accepted!"
 bavariafocus.14.d:0 "No one believed this could happen - and yet it did. The conservative groups simply could not get the government to accept classic Catholicism again. Instead, Protestantism now plays a big role in the everyday-life of the Bavarian citizen. Still, the conservative groups refuse to give up on their beloved Catholic Church and the Bavarian people are now clearly divided."
 bavariafocus.14.a:0 "New times require new standards."
 bavariafocus.15.t:0 "Bavaria - A Friend?"
 bavariafocus.15.d:0 "Bavarian advisors and politicians today arrived in Vienna and proposed silent cooperation between Bavaria and Austria, as both of us have something against Prussia, to say the least. While it would make sense for them to ask us to become allies, maybe we should not meddle with the German middle states too much. On the other hand, with some political work, we could get a foothold in Bavaria, possibly making a battle against Prussia easier."
 bavariafocus.15.a:0 "The more allies on our side - the better."
 bavariafocus.15.b:0 "We don't need them."
 bavariafocus.16.t:0 "Bavaria - An Ally?"
 bavariafocus.16.d:0 "Yet again Bavarian advisors arrive in Vienna. This time their proposal is more drastic - seeing how Prussia keeps pushing their demands, Bavaria now wants us an official ally against them, feeling threatened by Prussia. This might be our chance to completely bring Bavaria on our side. However, this might incite the Prussians."
 bavariafocus.16.a:0 "If you think about it, Bavaria is not that different from Austria."
 bavariafocus.16.b:0 "We may have a common enemy, but we can manage alone."
 bavariafocus.17.t:0 "Talks With Austria Going Well"
 bavariafocus.17.d:0 "Today our advisors came back from Vienna with good news. Our proposals to Austria were accepted and the relationship between our two countries is steadily growing. While this is good news to us, Prussia should not be that happy about this development. We should tread with cation."
 bavariafocus.17.a:0 "This will help our relationship grow."
 bavariafocus.18.t:0 "Talks With Austria Continue to Go Well"
 bavariafocus.18.d:0 "And again our advisors come back, bringing good news with them. Austria now officially sees us as an ally after considering the pros and cons of this coalition. As long as our common enemy Prussia exists, this coalition will too."
 bavariafocus.18.a:0 "In these times allies are a must."
 bavariafocus.19.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Support Bismarck's Parliament"
 bavariafocus.19.d:0 "Bismarck's proposal for a parliament seems to have found some popularity in Bavaria. This proposal is Bismarck's last try to bring the German middle states together and maybe with Bavaria agreeing to it it could succeed. Time will tell, but for now Bavaria seems to have become a little more open to Prussian politics. We could either accept their support, or reject it, the choice is still ours."
 bavariafocus.19.a:0 "It's not too late for them."
 bavariafocus.19.b:0 "They're just trying to kiss up to us."
 bavariafocus.20.t:0 "Prussia Accepts our Support!"
 bavariafocus.20.d:0 "Prussia just accepted our support for Bismarck's parliament. Maybe this will bring us a step closer to a German unification, or at least improve the relation between Bavaria and Prussia. Either way, this is good news, and we can stop holding our breath."
 bavariafocus.20.a:0 "Maybe we can avoid escalation after all."
 bavariafocus.21.t:0 "Bavaria Wants Unity"
 bavariafocus.21.d:0 "Bavaria once again wants to support our deed, and this time it is about German unity. Seeing how a war is probably inevitable, Bavaria wants to support us. While we do not think that Bavaria really wants to go to war, but only tries to gain some allies in case of it, they could be a good ally to have in the south. At the very least the Bavarian territory could be used as a temporary buffer between the German middle states and us."
 bavariafocus.21.a:0 "Very well, there shall be unity."
 bavariafocus.21.b:0 "Nothing but lies. We shouldn't trust them."
 bavariafocus.22.t:0 "Prussia Agrees!"
 bavariafocus.22.d:0 "After some wait, we have received message that Prussia agreed to our support. Now we have a strong ally on our side, but are right between the other German states and Austria, all of whom are strictly against Prussian reforms. Still, we now do not have to fear being alone in the case of war."
 bavariafocus.22.a:0 "Today is a good day."
 #(Austria)
 bavariafocus.23.t:0 "Military Consultative Commission"
 bavariafocus.23.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results state that there is a high possibility of us surviving the upcoming war if we were to fight on Austrias side, as the latest developments have shown that Austria has a high enough political opinion of us to be our ally. Ultimately we did not learn anything we did not know before, seeing how Austria agreed to all of our proposals. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Austrias side."
 bavariafocus.23.a:0 "The commission is over."
 #(lean Austria)
 bavariafocus.24.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were less clear than we had hoped them to be, stating that while Austria has its differences, it would probably be still a better idea to fight on their side instead of trying to survive alone. The Austrians agreed to most of our proposals, making an alliance in the case of war likely, but not definite. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Austrias side in case of war, but still be careful around them."
 #(Prussia)
 bavariafocus.25.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were surprising, to say the least, with the commission recommending Prussia as an ally. Prussia and Bavaria are not the best friends per se and have their cultural and political differences, but recent developments have shown that the Prussians might not be as aggressive against Bavaria as we thought them to be. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Prussia's side."
 #(lean Prussia)
 bavariafocus.26.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were slightly surprising, with the commission recommending Prussia as an ally in case of war. However, the commission pointed out that Prussia's main goal is to expand their reach, meaning one day they might turn against us. As such we should be very careful when joining an alliance with Prussia. Either way, the Military Consultative Commission thinks it would be a good idea to be on Prussias side, but still have an eye on their actions."
 #(neutral)
 bavariafocus.27.d:0 "Today the Military Consultative Commission was held. The results were disappointing at most, if anything. Instead of producing a clear statement, the commission could not find an agreement between its members. As such, not Prussia nor Austria seem to be good options in case of war. Maybe we should try to stay neutral, even if that seems unlikely at first."
 bavariafocus.28.t:0 "Bavarian Customs"
 bavariafocus.28.d:0 "Bavaria is a country of culture, arts and customs. With the new Republic established, however, we now have to ask ourselves if this can go on like this. We could try convincing our people to be more understanding towards other cultures and religions, and separate state and religion."
 bavariafocus.28.a:0 "Our customs and culture are important to our people."
 bavariafocus.28.b:0 "Maybe a change of pace would be good."
 bavariafocus.29.t:0 "Bavaria Decides"
 bavariafocus.29.d:0 "With two Kings gone in such a short time and new social ideas embraced, the government is in a turmoil. Now is our chance to form the future of our country, by taking the leashes in our own hands. Before we do any mistakes we will regret doing in the future though, we must first decide how to approach this. We could either try to take over the government from the inside, or call for a revolution."
 bavariafocus.29.a:0 "This is our chance to take over the government without any bloodshed."
 bavariafocus.29.b:0 "There is no way the nobles will give in. The only way is revolution."
 bavariafocus.30.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts!"
 bavariafocus.30.d:0 "[From.GetName] seemingly liked our proposal, and accepted it! Now we can move on and gather other allies. Together we are strong!"
 bavariafocus.30.a:0 "Great news!"
 bavariafocus.31.t:0 "[From.GetName] Denies!"
 bavariafocus.31.d:0 "To our regret, [From.GetName] denied our proposal. We should move on and try convincing others to join us."
 bavariafocus.31.a:0 "They don't understand how important this is."
 bavariafocus.32.t:0 "Nuremberg's Industrie- und Kulturverein Established!"
 bavariafocus.32.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Industrie- und Kulturverein in Nuremberg has been established. It will actively try to support and stimulate our industry and spread of our culture. Additionally it will help us gain more local influence in Nuremberg."
 bavariafocus.32.a:0 "Good to hear!"
 bavariafocus.33.t:0 "Bezirksamt Erlangen Established!"
 bavariafocus.33.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Bezirksamt Erlangen has been established. Because of how fast Erlangen, the small city in the proximity of Nuremberg has grown, the Bezirksamt makes sure that we as the Bavarian government have full control over the agrarian culture and industry in that area."
 bavariafocus.33.a:0 "Wunderbar!"
 bavariafocus.34.t:0 "The Culture of Munich"
 bavariafocus.34.d:0 "Since Ludwig I Munich has been the centre of Bavarian culture. The city is the main contributor to the Bavarian image and is our capital at the same time. As instructed by us, Bavarian culture will now go beyond Munich and reach even the smallest villages and towns of the [Root.GetName]."
 bavariafocus.34.a:0 "Ausgezeichnet!"
 bavariafocus.35.t:0 "The Pride of the Bavarians"
 bavariafocus.35.d:0 "Today [Root.GetLeader] made a speech, telling the people that they, as [From.GetAdjectiveCap]s, should be proud of themselves. The speech was received with loud clapping and the following night one could hear and see joyful singing, dancing and drinking everywhere. Ein Prosit auf Bayern!"
 bavariafocus.35.a:0 "We are a proud nation!"
 bavariafocus.36.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Play Big"
 bavariafocus.36.d:0 "Today the Kingdom of Bavaria announced that from now on it wants to play a bigger role in the Concert of Europe, and find its place in it. Seeing how it is the biggest and most influential German middle state, some think that Bavaria's wish to be noticed by others could be succesful, provided they take part in international politics, like the big powers do. Others, however, think that this wish is merely that, noting that the Kingdom of Bavaria never before had any interest in being a part of the Concert. While small countries like some other German middle states seemingly want Bavaria to succeed in becoming more important, the main and long-established powers in Europe, mainly France, Prussia and Austria, would like Bavaria to stay in its current position."

 bavariafocus.36.b:0 "This is merely wishful thinking."
 bavariafocus.37.t:0 "Bavaria Wants to Play Safe"
 bavariafocus.37.d:0 "Today the Kingdom of Bavaria announced that it wants to keep out of big, European politics. While it wants to still play a role in German matters, Bavaria does not wish to intervene in international ones. This decision, however, does not seem to surprise anyone, especially not seeing how big the main powers, namely France, Prussia and Austria have become. Seemingly not wanting to abandon its introvert policies and culture, Bavaria wants to turn its attention to German areas, instead of trying to keep up with the neighbouring powerhouses that are Austria and Prussia."
 bavariafocus.37.a:0 "We shall keep our principles."
 bavariafocus.37.b:0 "A wise decision."
 bavariafocus.38.t:0 "Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal Extended!"
 bavariafocus.38.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal has been extended. Finished in 1846 and built during the reign of Ludwig I, the Donau-Main-Kanal has been an important tool for Bavarian trade ever since. With the expansion finished, it now allows us to use more ships for trade, making Bavaria more important when it comes to trading."
 bavariafocus.38.a:0 "Ships sure are something."
 bavariafocus.39.t:0 "Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn Extended!"
 bavariafocus.39.d:0 "As we have instructed, the Ludwig-Süd-Nord-Bahn has been extended. Named after Ludwig I, just like the Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal, it allows for fast transportation between Franconia and Upper Bavaria, even going so far to reach Saxony. After extending it with additional lines, it now grants us the possibility to transport our goods to more corners of Bavaria faster than ever before."
 bavariafocus.39.a:0 "Trains sure are something."
 bavariafocus.40.t:0 "Southgerman Confederation Formed!"
 bavariafocus.40.d:0 "It seems that the Triaspolitik of Bavaria and the other German middle states finally payed off. As of late, the middle states have been making common policy, guided by Bavaria, the biggest and most probably strongest middle state in the German area. Today, after endless discourses and debates, the Southgerman Confederation was born, officially lead by Bavaria. It is advertised by its members as the Third Deutschland, the third big Germanic power, right beside Austria and Prussia. However, it still remains a mystery whether this brand new alliance will bear any fruit and keep up with the European powers."
 bavariafocus.40.a:0 "We will be a power to be reckoned with."

 bavariaevent.0.d:0 "The Bavarian King Maximilian II has today suggested withdrawing the freedom of the press and suffrage. Remembering the German Revolution of 1848 and 1849, the King thinks that there should be stricter laws to prevent a return of such a movement. However, multiple advisors and politicians are unsure if that really is such a good idea. Many are concerned that such reforms could incite the people, making the situation only worse. Whether these suggested reforms will be implemented or not is still up in the air."

 bavariaevent.1.d:0 "The Frankfurter Fürstentag session began today on the 17th August 1863. The Fürstentag was initated by the Austrian Kaiser and deals with proposed reforms regarding the German Confederation. The proposed reforms, if enacted, would inter alia set up a parliamentary committee, bringing the German Confederation nearer to being a Federal State. On the other hand, Prussia proposed other plans for the reorganization of the German Confederation. We either could support the Austrian proposals, disapprove of them and support the Prussian ones or stay neutral."

 bavariaevent.7.t:0 "The German Question"
 bavariaevent.7.d:0 "Now that the German threat is gone, the Austrians will look forward to unite Germany as they like. Luckily, we chose the right side and are now one of the winners. As such, we are allowed to partake in the peace talks. We could try to have a say and get a few advantages for ourselves, but we also could leave it up to the Austrians. However, if we were to take part in the peace talks, we would need to keep in mind that our chance of achieving what we want would be dependent on how much our country developed or performed in the war."
 bavariaevent.7.a:0 "We should try to have a say."
 bavariaevent.7.b:0 "Let's leave it up to the Austrians."
 bavariaevent.8.t:0 "Treaty of Frankfurt"
 bavariaevent.8.d:0 "The peace talks are finally here. As we decided to have a say and be present during the talks, we now have to propose our demands or suggestions. As the North, led by Prussia, lost the war, we now have full control over Germany and can push through our interests.\n\nFirstly, we could demand the annexation of the Ruhrgebiet by Bavaria, as we already own Palatinate in that region. This could greatly benefit our industry, but we should be aware that if the Austrians do not recognize Bavaria as an industrializing country, we would have little chances in succeeding with this demand.\n\nAnother approach would be to just sit at the table, but let the Austrians do all the actual work. Being present at the peace talks and being victorious already makes us quite popular. Additionally, it would not be a bad idea to be on the good side of the Austrians.\n\nThe by far most daring suggestions would be the ones concerning the German unification. As to not be completely thrown aside, we could try to submit some ideas on how the unification should go."
 bavariaevent.8.a:0 "The Ruhr is rightfully Bavarian soil. We should demand it to be handed over to us."
 bavariaevent.8.b:0 "Whatever the Austrians say, we should agree for the sake of relations."
 bavariaevent.8.c:0 "Unification is key. Conveniently, we have some ideas how it could be reached."
 bavariaevent.9.t:0 "Bavaria Demands the Ruhrgebiet"
 bavariaevent.9.d:0 "Taking part in the peace talks, [BAV.GetNameDef] today demanded the Ruhr to be officially handed over to them. As we have defeated the Prussians on the field, we theoretically can do whatever we want with that piece of land. In fact, if Bavaria were to annex the Ruhrgebiet, it would weaken the industry of [PRS.GetNameDef] immensely. We could, however, decline and do something else with it."
 bavariaevent.9.a:0 "Let them have it. Bavaria is a friend."

 bavariaevent.10.t:0 "Deutscher Staatenbund"
 bavariaevent.10.d:0 "As no apparent answer to the German Question could have been found until now, we have to decide what to do for the time being. Unification seems to be a much more complicated thing to accomplish than we thought it would be, and now we have to act before the German states turn away from us.\nMany in our government have come to like the temporary idea of forming a Schutzbund, a temporary, protective federation, to ensure stability and safety along the German areas. It was decided that this faction is to be established within the next days. However, it is yet to be decided how to handle this federation; we could either directly subjugate the German states and initiate the Schutzbund to play safe, or we could create the Schutzbund without subjugating anyone, as that could lead to mistrust."

Every German state would be forcefully annexed by them, to be ruled from Vienna through Munich. If we were to agree to this proposal, German unification would finally be accomplished and we would have full power over all German land without risking too much, like protests in our home country. However, we have to keep in mind that this possibly could be a power grab from Bavaria, even though they have been quite well-disposed towards us."

Every German state would be annexed by them, to be ruled from Vienna through Munich, except from the ones who were our allies in the past war. Instead, our past allies, mostly consisting of the southern German states, would be asked whether they would like to become a part of the to be formed German Confederation. If they deny, they will simply become subjects of the new Germany, maintaining their old and rightful borders and territories. It is now up to us to decide whether this new Germany becomes reality, or not."

 bavariaevent.13.d:0 "The time has come to present our plans for Germany to the Austrians. Still, we need to decide what exactly we will propose to them; on that matter we have two major ideas on how to establish a unified Germany.\n\nThe first idea would be to forcefully unify Germany under Bavaria, while Bavaria itself becomes a subjugated state of Austria. This would make our dream of a Bavarian Germany reality, even if Austria would become our overlord.\n\nThe second idea would be to give the German states who were our allies in the previous war a choice: either they join us and become a part of the New Germany, or they maintain their borders, but are subjugated to us.\n\nWhile the first idea sounds more pleasing, the second one would ensure that no previous ally turns sour on us. However, we should note that the ones who have the final say remain the Austrians. Whether they will accept our proposal depends on how we decided to be seen by the other European powers."

The Austrians accepted the Bavarian proposal, seemingly liking the sound of finally uniting the German states, and as such [GEC.GetNameDef] was born.

Discontent continues in the regions outside of Austria proper, causing many advisors to believe that the central government may be forced to give concessions to the provincial governments in order to prevent a repeat of 1848. With our former ally, Russia, no longer supporting us, it is of the utmost importance that the sentiment of revolution does not stir again, as the empire came close to collapse the last time it did.

For centuries, the Italian peninsula has been split between many kingdoms and has been dominated by foreign powers, such as France or Austria. A unified Italian Kingdom would pose a large threat to current Austrian holdings in Northern Italy. Such a kingdom would also be a large threat to the continuation of the Austrian Empire, as it is highly unlikely that they will be willing to ally us.

 #Shogunate Japan
 shogunate_japan.0.t:0 "The Tokugawa Shogunate"
 shogunate_japan.0.d:0 "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan entered into an era of unprecedented unity, stability, and progress under his new Shogunate. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the bakufu capital, would see the beginnings of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea under the policy of sakoku, or closed country, enacted between 1633-1639. With its strong isolationist stance, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and other Western influences within the country, maintaining its independence, at the cost of sealing off contact with modern innovations, save for a small Dutch trading post in the bay of Nagasaki called Dejima. Although contacts with the Dutch were limited, Japanese scholars were able to obtain a fair amount of knowledge on modern medicine and technology through the Rangaku studies, but the country as a whole still lagged far behind the West. \n \nThis 220-year paradigm, and the peace that came with it, suddenly came to a screeching halt when American Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Edo Bay on July 8, 1853 and demanded that Japan end its long period of isolation and adopt formal trade relations with the US. To back up his demands were the might of his powerful steamships, which the Japanese called the black ships because of the color of the warships and the smoke that belched out of their coal-fired steam engines. The Shogunate, virtually threatened at gunpoint to end sakoku, finally agreed to sign the Convention of Kanagawa with Perry on March 31, 1854. The terms of the Convention agreed to the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels, ensured the safety of American castaways, and established an American consul in Japan. \n \nThe aftermath of the Convention would cast a huge shadow of doubt over the Shogun's historical responsibility to oppose Western encroachment into Japan, and it was the catalyst for the rise of the Sonno Joi movement, or the belief that the Shogun was no longer capable of resisting the West, and that the Emperor should be entrusted with such an important role. With the security of Japan deeply threatened, the Shogunate overturned many of its policies restricting its naval capabilities in 1855, and desperately sought to improve the strength of its defenses as quickly as possible. However, centuries of peace have atrophied fighting capability of Japanese troops, and with growing discontent from the historically hostile tozama daimyo, the Shogunate is quickly approaching its day of reckoning..."
 shogunate_japan.0.a:0 "Hajime!"
 shogunate_japan.1.t:0 "The Harris Treaty"
 shogunate_japan.1.d:0 "An envoy from [USA.GetNameDef] by the name of Townsend Harris has once again approached the bakufu, seeking the ratification of a new, so-called Treaty of Amity and Commerce. Its contents include an exchange of diplomatic agents between the US and Japan, the additional opening of the ports of Kanagawa and Nagasaki to the existing ports of Shimoda and Hakodate agreed to be opened originally in the Convention of Kanagawa, to be effective July 4th 1859, extraterritoriality rights for their citizens, new fixed low import-export duties subject to international control, and the right of freedom of religious expression to US nationals in Japan. \n \nThese demands are much higher than the treaty signed with Perry in the past, and the sudden introduction of foreigners into the shogunal capital of Edo is bound to cause a great deal of socioeconomic instability. However, we are sadly in no real position to oppose these demands, and if we were to refuse this treaty we may end up the same way China did in their Opium War. Our only choice now is, should we bring this before the Emperor and convince him to ratify the treaty, or is the signature of a bakufu official enough?"
 shogunate_japan.1.a:0 "We must convince the Emperor to ratify."
 shogunate_japan.1.b:0 "Foreign policy is the Shogunate's responsibility."
 shogunate_japan.2.t:0 "The Emperor's Decision"
 shogunate_japan.2.d:0 "Despite our special envoy Lord Hotta Masayoshi's best efforts to convince Emperor Komei in his Kyoto court to accept the terms of the American unequal treaty, the Emperor firmly believes that no such deals should be made with barbarians as their presence on our isles would violate its sanctity. As our Emperor's understanding of these foreigners stems merely from ukiyo-e prints of Westerners depicted as deplorable demons, it is unlikely that the bakufu has any capability of convincing him to open our ports to their traders. \n \nAlthough the Shogun himself could still ratify the treaty, acceding to the Westerners' demands without Imperial support would certainly sow popular disapproval of the bakufu."
